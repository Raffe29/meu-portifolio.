        <p>
          I'm a 16-year-old programmer currently attending classes at SENAI
          Alfried Krupp, where I'm pursuing a technical course in
          administration. Recently, I had a class with Professor Anderson, where
          he taught us about using Excel for cash flow management. This
          experience sparked a brilliant idea in my mind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          From that point, the idea of creating financial management software,
          focusing on cash flow control, using web technologies like HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript, emerged. However, this project stood out as the most
          challenging one I've taken on so far. The reason? Mainly due to the
          heavy use of JavaScript, and also because I was working with a
          relatively new library for me, called "chart.js."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          To make the project a reality, I had to dive into the "chart.js"
          library to understand how to apply it effectively. It was a period of
          intense learning but extremely rewarding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          While I was developing the software, I created a message that I
          decided to include in it: "Money is like a hammer; it can be used to
          build or destroy, depending on how we wield it." This quote reflects
          my belief that financial management is a powerful tool, and how we use
          it can impact both the construction and destruction of our goals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          After a few days of intense coding, I finally completed the software.
          I proudly presented it to friends and teachers, and I was thrilled to
          receive positive feedback. But the most rewarding moment was when my
          father, who is an entrepreneur in the construction industry, showed a
          great interest in my work and started using the software to manage his
          company's finances. This left me very pleased, as I saw that my
          project not only met expectations but also had a practical impact in
          the real world.
        </p>

      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          This process of creating financial management software taught me not
          only technical skills but also valuable lessons about perseverance,
          continuous learning, and the importance of applying knowledge
          practically. I look forward to continuing to explore the world of
          programming and further developing my skills, aiming to create
          innovative and useful solutions for people and businesses.
