          Turning Creativity into Unique Accessories with HTML, CSS, and

          Being a 17-year-old young programmer, the opportunity to be part of
          the Sarafocs project was an incredibly enriching experience. This
          project, carried out with dedication and love, was born within the
          premises of SENAI ALFRIED KRUPP, where I immersed myself in the world
          of programming and technology.

          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          With nearly 6,000 lines of code and countless hours dedicated, I was a
          fundamental part of the team that played a significant role in the
          development of this website. Seeing my contribution come to life was
          exhilarating and filled me with pride.

        <p>
          The Sarafocs website serves as an inspiring example of how technology
          can be the engine of a company's success. The vision was clear: to
          turn creative ideas into reality, allowing customers to customize
          products according to their needs and desires. Being part of this
          project was a privilege and an invaluable learning opportunity.

        </style>

        <p>
          This project goes beyond being just an online platform. It's a global
          showcase that embraces the uniqueness of brands and events. If you're
          looking for a mug that's not just a mug, a keychain that tells a
          story, or a cushion that conveys a special message, Sarafocs is the
          right destination. Every line of code and every element of the
          interface was developed to ensure that each customized accessory is an
          expression of quality and originality.
        </p>

      <div class="pr3">
        <style>
          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          At the heart of this project is creativity, the fuel that drives each
          piece. As a young programmer, even at my age, I'm proud to have
          contributed to turning the ordinary into the extraordinary,
          transforming simple accessories into personal or commercial
          statements.

          @import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/reddit-mono");
        </style>

        <p>
          The website's technology, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is the
          foundation that enables the creative transformation into unique
          accessories. Every line of code is a reflection of our commitment to
          share passion and creativity with the world. It's a journey that has
          shaped my love for programming and has given me the opportunity to be
          part of something remarkable at the age of 16.
